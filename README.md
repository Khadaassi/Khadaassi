## About me


<p>


I am an enthusiastic student with a strong foundation in programming and web development. My education at Holberton School, where I studied languages and tools such as C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Docker, and VSCode, has provided me with a diverse and solid technical skill set.

I am currently gaining practical experience as a Data Analyst Apprentice at Decathlon, where I'm applying my skills to real-world projects.

#### My Journey So Far

My career path is quite unconventional, but itâ€™s a journey I'm proud of. After studying English Literature, I dedicated several years to homeschooling my children, This period taught me invaluable skills such as multitasking, organization, and resilience, which I now bring to my journey in tech.

In October 2023, I took a leap of faith and began my studies at <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">Holberton School</a> to start a new career in technology, where I built a strong foundation in core programming languages particularly with Python.

In October 2024, I furthered my education at <a href="https://simplon.co/formation/ecole-ia-microsoft/23" target="_blank">Simplon's Microsoft AI School</a>. This exciting opportunity allowed me to specialize in Data and AI development, opening new doors for professional growth.

September 2025 marks a new chapter as I joined <a href="https://digital.decathlon.net/" target="_blank">Decathlon</a> as a Data Analyst Apprentice. This role allows me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects and grow as a professional.

#### Future Ambitions

I am committed to a lifelong journey of learning and growth in the tech industry. As I continue my training at Simplon's Microsoft AI School and my apprenticeship at Decathlon, I aim to expand my knowledge in data and AI. My goal is to work on projects that have a meaningful impact and to collaborate with passionate professionals who challenge me to grow.

#### What Drives Me

My unconventional path has taught me that the most valuable skills are not always taught in a classroom. The resilience and adaptability I gained from homeschooling and my background in literature are what truly fuel my passion for tech. I am driven by the challenge of turning complex data into clear, actionable insights and am excited to bring my unique blend of human understanding and technical expertise to future projects.
